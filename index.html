In May of this year, bus drivers and union officials <a href= "https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/transit/2022/05/19/mta-workers-fed-up-with-assaults--harassment-demand-protections"> denounced </a> being victims of constant physical and verbal abuse in their jobs from people. The workers demanded greater protection from the police as they were reporting the highest number of assaults and harassment in the year. 
Despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/04/nyregion/new-york-subway-safety.html#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20there%20have%20been,data">analysis </a>from The New York Times that shows that the possibility of becoming a victim of violent crimes in the subway is remote, M.T.A  workers describe being victims of explosive behaviors from people. 
Random high-profile crimes such as shootings, and riders being shoved in front of trains have sparked the fear of workers and riders across the system, but the assaults and harrasments are the constant struggle for traffic workers who report and average of 165 assaults per week this year, a lower number compared to 2021 figure whic showed an average of 194 assaults reported per week. 
On October 22nd, Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-and-mayor-adams-announce-major-actions-keep-subways-safe-and-address-transit">announced</a> the payment of 1,200 overtime police shifts to have police officers patrolling 24/7 at different subway stations.

“It feels good, it’s security to another level,” said Brando Crawford, a MTA subway conductor who told <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/11/15/23451820/new-subway-police-presence-conductors-safety">The City</a> he welcomes the effort to make riders and traffic workers feel safe while they’re in the stations.
